## What It Now Looks Like

**Top Navigation**: OpenGov branding + nav menu + Create button

  - Tabs (AI, Workflow, Messages, etc.)
  - 3 quick action buttons
  - Chat messages
  - Input field with action buttons

## How to View

The changes use hot reload, so if your dev server is running:
1. Just refresh your browser at http://localhost:3000
2. The new OpenGov-style UI should appear immediately

The colors, tabs, and layout now closely match the OpenGov screenshot you provided!
